<p>
This is a landing page. I just didn't like the default one, for various reasons. <br>
The most obvious, of course, being that it doesn't point to any of the actual pages on this site. That won't do at all, will it? <br>
Well, not that there really <i>is</i> anything of note here.
</p>
<p><div class="menu">
Sooner or later, I’ll make a halfway decent menu or something, but for now:<br>
<a href="MLSongList.html">Here is a list of the solo songs presently in Million Live: Theater Days</a>.<br>
<a href="offertext.html">I think the push notifications for the recently-added Offers in Theater Days are pretty fun, so I've collected the text of them here!</a><br>
<a href="mirikurotext.html">And here is various Million Closet related information.</a><br>
<br>
<a href="wingcheat.html">This is a cheatsheet for the W.I.N.G. semifinals and finals in Shiny Colors.</a><br>
<a href="shinyroad.html">This is a mission listing for Shinymas's new Idol Road feature.</a>
</div>
</p>
<p id="tiny">
I hope you appreciate this being Shiho brown. I know I do.<br>
At some point, I'll probably add some styling to this beyond that. Probably.

    God this place is barren.
